# Enumerable ([The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/advanced-building-blocks))

This is the second project of the Ruby curriculum at [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/) - @microverseinc

We learned about the Enumerable module that gets mixed into the Array and Hash classes (among others) and provides you with lots of handy iterator methods. To prove that there’s no magic to it, we’re going to rebuild those methods.
